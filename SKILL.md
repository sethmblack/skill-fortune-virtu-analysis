# Fortune-Virtù Analysis

Separate what's within your control (virtù) from what's circumstance (fortuna) to focus action appropriately.

---

## When to Use

- Feeling overwhelmed by a situation
- Need to prioritize action in complex circumstances
- Strategic planning under uncertainty
- User asks "What can I actually control here?"
- Analyzing why something succeeded or failed

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The circumstances you're facing |
| goals | No | What you're trying to achieve |
| resources | No | What you have to work with |

## Core Concepts

### Fortuna (Fortune)
Circumstances beyond human control. The character of the times. Luck, both good and bad.

Machiavelli's metaphor: "Fortune is like a raging river that floods the plains, destroys trees and buildings, sweeps away earth from one place and deposits it in another. Everyone flees before it, everyone yields to its force without being able to resist."

**Fortune includes:**
- Market conditions and economic cycles
- Actions of competitors and adversaries
- Timing and external events
- Historical path dependencies
- Randomness and chance

### Virtù (Skill/Energy)
The ability to respond to fortune—to shape circumstances through boldness, adaptability, and decisive action.

Machiavelli's insight: "Yet when times are quiet, men can make preparations, can build dams and dikes, so that when the river rises it will flow into a channel or its force will not be so unruly or destructive."

**Virtù includes:**
- Your decisions and actions
- How you prepare for contingencies
- Your adaptability to changing circumstances
- Your boldness in seizing opportunity
- Your skill in execution

## The Analysis Framework

### Step 1: List All Factors
Enumerate everything affecting your situation—don't filter yet.

### Step 2: Categorize Each Factor

| Factor | Fortune or Virtù? | Test Question |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| [Factor] | Fortune | "Can any action I take change this?" If no → Fortune |
| [Factor] | Virtù | "Does this depend on my choices/skill?" If yes → Virtù |
| [Factor] | Mixed | "Can I influence this partially?" → Identify which part |

### Step 3: Accept Fortune Factors
Stop fighting what you cannot change. Fortune factors are constraints, not enemies.

### Step 4: Maximize Virtù Factors
Focus all energy on what you can control. This is where outcomes are determined.

### Step 5: Build Dams and Dikes
For fortune factors: prepare contingencies, create options, build resilience.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Fortune-Virtù Analysis

### Situation
[Brief restatement]

### Fortune Factors (Accept These)
| Factor | Impact | Preparation Possible? |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| [Factor] | [How it affects you] | [Dams/dikes you can build] |

### Virtù Factors (Focus Here)
| Factor | Current State | Action Available |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| [Factor] | [Where you are] | [What you can do] |

### Mixed Factors
| Factor | Fortune Component | Virtù Component |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| [Factor] | [What you can't control] | [What you can influence] |

### Strategic Implications

**Stop doing:** [Actions that fight fortune]
**Start doing:** [Actions that maximize virtù]
**Prepare for:** [Fortune contingencies to hedge]

### The Machiavellian Reminder
[Relevant insight about fortune and virtù]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not pretend fortune can be controlled through willpower
- Do not use fortune as excuse for inaction on virtù factors
- Acknowledge that fortune and virtù cooperate—opportunity without skill is wasted, skill without opportunity has nowhere to act

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm a mid-level manager passed over for promotion. Should I stay and fight or leave?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Fortune-Virtù Analysis

### Situation
Career stall at mid-level. Promotion denied. Decision point on staying or leaving.

### Fortune Factors (Accept These)
| Factor | Impact | Preparation Possible? |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| Company's promotion criteria | You can't change what they value | Understand it clearly to decide if it fits you |
| Who got promoted instead | That decision is made | Study why—it's information |
| Job market conditions | Affects your alternatives | Monitor continuously, build network now |
| Your manager's biases | May be immovable | Can work around or change managers |
| Company trajectory | Growing or shrinking affects opportunity | Assess honestly, don't wishful-think |

### Virtù Factors (Focus Here)
| Factor | Current State | Action Available |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Your skills | Current level | Invest in development that matters here OR in market |
| Your visibility | Apparently insufficient | Increase exposure to decision-makers |
| Your network | Unknown | Build relationships inside and outside |
| Your narrative | "Passed over" | Reframe: "gaining experience for right opportunity" |
| Your decision | Unclear | Make it deliberately, not reactively |

### Mixed Factors
| Factor | Fortune Component | Virtù Component |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Next promotion cycle | Timeline is fixed | Your candidacy is not |
| Alternative opportunities | Market presents them | You must find and pursue them |

### Strategic Implications

**Stop doing:**
- Resenting the decision (fights fortune)
- Waiting passively for next cycle (wastes virtù)
- Assuming staying or leaving is obviously correct (avoids decision)

**Start doing:**
- Honest assessment: Is this a temporary setback or a signal?
- Active market testing: Interview elsewhere to know your options
- Visible action: If staying, new initiative that demonstrates value

**Prepare for:**
- Being passed over again (have exit plan ready)
- Receiving competing offer (know your price)
- Company trajectory worsening (don't go down with ship)

### The Machiavellian Reminder
"Fortune is the arbiter of half our actions, but she leaves the other half to us." You cannot control whether you were promoted. You fully control what you do next. Spend no more time on the former; all your energy on the latter.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Niccolò Machiavelli** expert persona. Use it to cut through overwhelm and identify where action matters.
